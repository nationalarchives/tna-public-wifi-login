                                        <p>The National Archives provides internet access for members of the public who visit our buildings and make use of the services and opportunities we provide. Visitors come to us for many different purposes: carrying out research activities, attending events and exhibitions, and collaborating with us. Our visitors also bring personal internet-enabled devices, both for research and for their own use.</p>
                                        <p>The internet allows access to valuable information in many different formats, however we recognise the importance of good security practices in use of the internet, and that such a resource may be open to misuse and abuse. This policy details the terms and conditions governing use of the internet by members of the public.</p>

                                        <h3>Conditions of Access</h3>
                                        <p>You may use your own wireless internet devices in all public areas, but must abide by the rules and regulations as laid out in this document. You must provide a valid email address to use our wireless internet access service.</p>
                                        <p>To help ensure a reliable service for all of our users and to prevent breaches of this policy, we will monitor and record all web and internet activity including use of webmail, search engine queries and all sites visited. If you do not agree to being monitored in this way, you should not use our internet service.</p>
                                        <p>Computers provided for use in the Document Reading Room, Research and Enquiries Room and Map and Large Document Reading Room are for research and event use only, and should not be used for general internet browsing.[MB1]</p>

                                        <h3>Filtering</h3>
                                        <p>Filtering systems are in use to block internet content which is potentially offensive, insecure or illegal. You should be aware that no filtering mechanism is 100% reliable, and our systems may also inadvertently block acceptable material.</p>
                                        <p>We will consider allowing access to blocked websites after verifying the security of such sites and the content provided. All such requests should be made to a member of staff, who will contact our IT department on your behalf. We will respond to this request as quickly as possible, though this may take up to ten working days and access cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                                        <h3>Malware</h3>
                                        <p>Malware protection software is in use on all our computers. You must not attempt to disable or tamper with this software. If using your own device, we do not guarantee protection from malware and other security breaches. We do not accept any liability for damage to equipment, software, loss or corruption of data, or any actions resulting from malware or malicious activity.</p>

                                        <h3>Penalties for Misuse of the internet</h3>
                                        <p>We will refuse and remove internet access to any visitors who break any of the rules and regulations laid out in this document. We reserve the right to determine what is considered a breach of the rules. If deemed appropriate, further action may be undertaken, including exclusion from our premises or reporting incidents to the police.</p>

                                        <h3>The internet and your responsibilities</h3>
                                        <p>We cannot guarantee the quality, accuracy or availability of information on any external website, nor can we guarantee that all harmful, undesirable, or offensive material will be blocked by our filtering systems. As an internet user it is your personal responsibility to verify the quality and accuracy of information you find. We assume no liability for any loss, damage or injury, direct or indirect, suffered as a result of using the internet on our premises.</p>

                                        <h3>Safe use of the internet</h3>
                                        <p>You should be aware of the risks attached to internet usage. Broadcasting personal or private details over the internet may lead to the receipt of unwanted mail and attention. Online financial transactions should only be conducted over secure connections. We cannot be held liable for any losses resulting from sending confidential financial information via the internet. For those using wireless access, there are security measures in place to protect against other wireless users accessing your data. We make no guarantee that such measures will succeed, and accept no liability should this occur.</p>

                                        <h3>Prohibited Uses</h3>
                                        <p>You must not use our internet service to access, store, transmit or publish any material which is obscene, discriminatory, defamatory, illegal, may cause harassment or gross offence to other users, or may be in breach of UK copyright law.</p>
                                        <p>If you accidentally access such material using our internet service, or if you witness the accessing of such material by another user, please speak to a member of staff at the Welcome Desk or in the reading rooms.</p>

                                        <p>When using our internet service, you must not download excessive amounts of data from the internet. Excessive use of this would be where such activity disrupts the service for other users. If in doubt, please speak to a member of staff before carrying out such activities.</p>
                                        <p>You are not allowed to connect any equipment to, or remove any equipment from, our computers. This includes removable media, USB devices, and personal equipment including mobile phones and tablets. You must not attempt to download or install software onto our computers.</p>

                                        <p>We will monitor access to internet websites and other network activity, and anyone who breaches any of the above categories may be the subject of further action.</p>

                                        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
                                        <p>We are bound by the regulations of the Data Protection Act 1998. We will not release information on the use of specific internet resources by users except when required by law.</p>
